### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Use appropriate configuration

To reproduce Figure 1 from our paper, please ensure 

1. You have GSE18842 and GSE19804 datasets inside datasets/ folder.

2. Your configuration (config.yaml) contains the following:

```bash
    train_test_sep: 1                                     # 0 = internal train-test split; 1 = external test set
    dataset: "Lung_GSE18842"                               # Identifier for the dataset used      
    filepath: "./datasets/Lung_GSE18842.csv"               # Path to the input data file   
    test_dataset: "Lung_GSE19804"                          # If train_test_sep is 1, then provide identifier for the test dataset
    test_filepath: "./datasets/Lung_GSE19804.csv"          # If train_test_sep is 1, then provide path to the test data file   
    target: 'type'                                          # Column name for target labels
    
    
    model_name: "RF"                                        # Model used: RF = Random Forest
    opt_model: 0                                            # Use an optimized (1) /default (0) config for the model
    random_state: 42                                        # Seed for reproducibility
    debug: 0                                                # 1 = Print detailed debug info; 0 = minimal output
    num_runs: 20                                            # Number of repeated runs (for averaging)
    remove_cols: True                                       # Whether to remove previously selected features. If number of features are more than 20,000 - set it to true

    plot_acc: 1                                              # Plot accuracy vs. number of features
    plot_auc: 1                                              # Plot AUC vs. number of features

    interactive: 0                                           # 1 = Interactive code execution, asking for confirmationl 0: no confirmation required
    shuffle_cols: 0                                          # If 1, feature columns are shuffled before selection

    feature_ticks_ranges:                                    # Number of features to try in each experiment run
    - [1, 51, 1]
    - [60, 201, 10]
    - [300, 2001, 100]

    annotate_paper_results: 0                                # Whether to add marker for a published paper's result. If 1, then paper, x_from_paper and y_from_paper should be defined.
    # paper: "Lall (2020)"                                   # Citation or label for the paper
    # x_from_paper: 35                                       # Feature count used in the paper
    # y_from_paper: .86                                      # Reported accuracy in the paper
```

We have also provided a dataset golub_all_aml.csv with this repository. To run the code with this dataset and also annotate the accuracy plot, use the following config (already included, so NO action needed):

```bash
train_test_sep: 0              # 0 = internal train-test split; 1 = external test set
dataset: "ALL_AML"             # Identifier for the dataset used
filepath: "./datasets/golub_all_aml.csv"  # Path to the input data file
target: "type"                 # Column name for target labels

model_name: "RF"               # Model used: RF = Random Forest
opt_model: 1                   # Use an optimized/default config for the model
random_state: 42               # Seed for reproducibility
debug: 0                       # 1 = Print detailed debug info; 0 = minimal output
num_runs: 20                   # Number of repeated runs (for averaging)
remove_cols: False             # Whether to remove previously selected features

plot_acc: 1                    # Plot accuracy vs. number of features
plot_auc: 1                    # Plot AUC vs. number of features

interactive: 0                 # 1 = Interactive code execution, asking for confirmationl 0: no confirmation required
shuffle_cols: 0                # If 1, feature columns are shuffled before selection

feature_ticks_ranges:          # Number of features to try in each experiment run
  - [1, 51, 1]
  - [60, 201, 10]
  - [300, 2001, 100]

annotate_paper_results: 1      # Whether to add marker for a published paper's result. If 1, then paper, x_from_paper and y_from_paper should be defined.
paper: "Lall (2020)"           # Citation or label for the paper
x_from_paper: 35               # Feature count used in the paper
y_from_paper: 0.86             # Reported accuracy or AUC in the paper

```

### 6. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

```bash
python3 runner_code.py
```

### 7. üìä Output 

Execution will create the following files for the dataset selected in the config file in the Plots/[DATASET] directory:

    1. accuracy plot 
    2. AUC plot
    3. The result csv file
